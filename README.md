SmokePreview
============

A [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) script
to add a preview to chat messages of the [SmokeDetector](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector).

Messages which are deleted while loading the preview will get a opacity of 50%
to make clear that this is not relevant.
